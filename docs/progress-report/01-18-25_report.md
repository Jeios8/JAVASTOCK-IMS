## **Current Progress**
1. **Development Environment Setup**:
    - Database schema and connections are fully functional.
    - Users and roles tables have been populated and tested.

2. **Code Integration**:
    - Updated `User` class to align with database schema.
    - `DatabaseConnector` utility and dynamic connections tested and verified.
    - Login validation integrated with database via `LoginVM`.

3. **UI Development**:
    - Completed `DashboardUI` implementation:
        - Includes role-based navigation and feature accessibility.
        - Refined to reflect inventory management-specific workflows.

4. **Testing**:
    - Verified database connectivity and dynamic role-based dashboard rendering.
    - Login functionality and redirection to `DashboardUI` tested successfully.

## **Pending Tasks**
1. **Security Enhancements**:
    - Implement bcrypt hashing for passwords in `users` table.
    - Validate passwords during login using hashed values.

2. **Feature Additions**:
    - Integrate inventory, supplier, and user management modules into the `DashboardUI`.
    - Add logout functionality and session management.

3. **Documentation**:
    - Finalize updated UML diagrams for `DashboardUI` and login flow.
    - Complete documentation for all implemented classes and modules.

4. **Testing**:
    - Begin integration testing for full workflows:
        - Login → Dashboard → Inventory/Supplier/User Management.

## **Challenges & Resolutions**
- **Challenge**: Dashboard design complexity for multi-role navigation.  
  **Resolution**: Simplified navigation logic and added default views based on roles.

- **Challenge**: Synchronizing database queries with UI updates.  
  **Resolution**: Added asynchronous fetch operations to avoid blocking UI actions.

## **Next Steps**
1. Implement bcrypt password hashing and update the `LoginVM` logic.
2. Begin integration testing of the `DashboardUI` with modules.
3. Refine UI/UX based on initial feedback from the team.
